# Diamond Collector
This repository just a simple game \
and this is my first game using HTML + CSS + JavaScript,\
this game can be played in desktop or mobile device

# Objective
- Collect diamond as many as you can (just collect the diamond that spawned)
- Don't get caught by enemy (don't get touched by red ball)

# Controls
You can use button in the screen (maybe little difficult) or use keyboard:

W / ArrowUp = Move Up\
A / ArrowLeft = Move Left\
S / ArrowDown = Move Down\
D / ArrowRight = Move Right\
ENTER = Start game or Pause game

*Note: This game has a bug in enemy collision if framerate is unstable (enemy collision: script.js line 269 & 273)
